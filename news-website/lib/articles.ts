      "The research, conducted over a three-year period with 10,000 participants across different age groups, found that people who used social media primarily to maintain meaningful connections with friends and family showed reduced rates of depression and anxiety.",
      '"What matters isn\'t how much time you spend on social media, but how you use that time," explained Dr. Jonathan Lee, the study\'s lead author. "Active engagement, like having meaningful conversations and sharing authentic experiences, can reduce feelings of isolation and increase a sense of belonging."',
      "The study distinguished between different types of social media use, categorizing them as either 'active' or 'passive.'",
      "Passive use, such as endless scrolling and comparing oneself to others, was still associated with negative mental health outcomes.",
      '"The findings suggest we need a more nuanced approach to social media guidelines," said Dr. Lee. "Rather than recommending people reduce their overall usage, we should be teaching more mindful and intentional ways of engaging online."',
      "The research has implications for how mental health professionals approach social media use in their treatment recommendations, as well as how platforms might be designed to encourage healthier forms of engagement.",

      "According to data released by the International Energy Agency (IEA), solar, wind, hydroelectric, and other renewable sources generated 51% of the world's electricity last month, compared to 49% from coal, oil, and natural gas.",
      '"This is a watershed moment in the global energy transition," said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. "Just ten years ago, renewables accounted for only 20% of global electricity. The pace of change has been remarkable."',
      "The shift has been driven by massive investments in renewable infrastructure, particularly in China, India, and the European Union, as well as rapidly declining costs of solar panels and wind turbines.",
      "The milestone comes as many countries have accelerated their clean energy transitions in response to both climate concerns and energy security issues highlighted by recent geopolitical conflicts.",
      '"What\'s particularly encouraging is that this transition is now being driven as much by economics as by environmental concerns," noted energy analyst Maria Chen. "In most parts of the world, it\'s simply cheaper to build new renewable capacity than to operate existing fossil fuel plants."',
      "Despite the achievement, experts caution that electricity represents only about 25% of total energy consumption, with transportation, industry, and heating still heavily reliant on fossil fuels.",
